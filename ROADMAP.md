# Roadmap / wishlist

#### App
- Socket connection and sync should start when the app boots, not just the Watchlist page

#### Dashboard
- Show total $ value of portfolio, total BTC value, and pie chart for entire portfolio. Update this only when dashboard is entered.

#### Layout
- Pin the title/hero/menu/toolbar to the top of each page
- Switch to TailwindCSS, or at the very least strip everything Bulma out, except for the layout stuff
- (MAY NOT BE NEEDED IF ABOVE) Switch from Bulma to Vuetify while preserving TailwindCSS
- (NICE TO HAVE) Collapse left nav down to icons only. Put an arrow "<<" button pinned to the bottom of the nav that collapses/expands the menu.
- (IF ABOVE) Tooltips for icons in collapsed nav
- (v0.0.16) ~~Pin left nav and let content area scroll independently~~
- (v0.0.12) ~~Improve layout for Watchlist coin cards~~
- (v0.0.13) ~~Move socket status to bottom of left-side menu~~

#### Watchlist

- List/Grid view with icons to switch between them. Save view state in Vuex/localStorage
- Display "bubbles" for each market (eg. BTC-USD, BTC-ETH, ETH-XMR, etc) instead of just the coins
- Separate coin details (price, etc) by exchange
- Compare current trade tick with history and color price green/red depending on +/- or black if no previous history
- Alphabetic sorting of coins/markets
- (NICE TO HAVE) Drag-sorting watched coins
- (v0.0.14) ~~Animate coin bubble when a trade updates (green/red depending on +/- then fade back to gray)~~
- (v0.0.13) ~~Retrieve last coin details from localStorage when mounting the app~~
- (v0.0.10) ~~Attach socket data to Vuex store~~
- (v0.0.10) ~~Save (latest) socket data in localStorage~~
- (v0.0.10) ~~Socket connectivity status~~

#### Menu / Sidebar
- (NICE TO HAVE) Button to connect to socket (disconnected by default -- not sure about this)

#### Settings
- Save settings in an object in localStorage and retrieve them when booting the app
- Option to switch between using the socket connection or the regular API for updating prices. API would update every X minutes.
- Allow assignment of different background colors for watched coins
- (v0.1.1) ~~When new coins are added to the default coins array, they should automatically be synced with the store/localStorage~~


#### Map syncing

- Add "My Asset" amount to watched coins
- (v0.1.1) ~~Allow other markets than USD (BTC-x, ETH-x, etc)~~
- (v0.0.17) ~~Store only diff between existing map in storage and new map (i.e. new coins only), don't touch existing items. This should preserve watched coins.~~
- (v0.0.2) ~~Use Vuex store instead of localStorage~~
- (v0.0.7) ~~Use localStorage to persist data, Vuex is for state management only~~
- (v0.0.3) ~~2-way binding between watch view <-> storage using computed getter/setter~~

#### Map view
- N/A ~~Messages for map sync should integrate better with the UI and disappear after a few seconds~~
- (v0.0.3) ~~Use computed view of watched/unwatched coins to display watched ones at the top by default~~
- (v0.0.5) ~~Filtering~~
- (v0.0.8) ~~Show count of filtered coins~~
- (LOW PRIORITY if filtering is implemented) Alphabetic sorting of coins

#### History
- Save tracked coin price history to indexedDB for each market/exchange
- History page
- Show history entries (later replaced or augmented by charts), tracked since, last price, low, high, trend

#### BUGS
- Refactor `watchedCoins`/`unwatchedCoins` to work off of `filteredCoins` ??
- (v0.0.19) ~~.../folio/node_modules/gsap/TweenMax.js:6907 Uncaught Cannot tween a null target. Seemed to occur right after watching a new coin when it started ticking.~~
- (v0.0.19) ~~Un-watching coins should remove them from the Watchlist~~
- (v0.0.18) ~~Regression introduced when preserving watched coins while syncing the map~~
- (v0.0.15) ~~Sometimes when on a page the corresponding menu option is not highlighted, seems to occur when live-reloading. This can be fixed by saving/retriving the selected menu from Vuex. No need for localStorage - this will reset the position to Home every time the app is started.~~
- (v0.0.5) ~~Date format for mapLastSynced retrieved from storage has wrong format~~
- (v0.0.4) ~~Desktop app build - routes don't work~~
- (v0.0.6) ~~Desktop app build - Vuex storage doesn't persist thru closing/reopening app~~
- (v0.0.5) ~~Match Case isn't working~~
